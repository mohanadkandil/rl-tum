	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Checkers is a strategy game involving diagonal moves of pieces and captures by jumping over opponent pieces.
		\item The objective of the project is to create an AI player using reinforcement learning.
		\item Techniques: Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What is Reinforcement Learning?}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A machine learning paradigm focused on training agents to make sequences of decisions.
		\item Key components:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Agent}: Learns to act in an environment.
			\item \textbf{Environment}: The system with which the agent interacts.
			\item  \textbf{Reward}: Feedback signal indicating the success of an action.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Goal: Maximize cumulative rewards over time.
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Future Work}
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fine-tuning the DQN model for improved decision-making.
		\item Incorporating advanced techniques like Double DQN and Dueling DQN.
		\item Testing against human players to evaluate real-world performance.
		\item Extending the approach to other board games or strategy games (some side-projects).
